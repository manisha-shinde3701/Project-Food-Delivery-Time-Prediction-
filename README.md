        Food delivery is a service that allows customers to order food from restaurants and have it delivered to their doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
        More businesses are moving online these days, and consumers are ordering online instead of traveling to the store to buy. Zomato and Swiggy are popular online platforms for ordering food products. Other examples are Uber Eats, Food Panda, and Deliveroo, which also have similar services. They provide food delivery options.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the order is complete, a partner will pick up and deliver the meal to the given address via a delivery service. In online food-ordering businesses, delivery time is critical. As a result, estimated food delivery time prediction to reach the buyerâ€™s location is critical.
